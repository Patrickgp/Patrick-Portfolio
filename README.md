# Patrick-Portfolio

https://patrickgp.github.io/Patrick-Portfolio/

My goal in creating this portfolio page was to provide a potential employer with a sample of my skill set as well as showing previous projects that helped me improve. In my portfolio page the viewer is presented with my name, a headshot of myself, and links to sections about me, my projects, and a contact page. I ensured that the links in my navigation would scroll "smoothly" to the corresponding section utilizing ID's. The screenshots of my past projects are linked to their corresponding websites which I have available through github pages and underneath each image is a description of the tools I used to construct that page and any goals or lessons I achieved/recieved. My "first" application per the requirements of the assignment is larger in its presence than the others. The most challenging part of the assignment was creating a responsive layout that adapts to any viewport and using multiple viewports i.e. iPad Air, Iphone 12, etc via Chrome's Dev Tools I was able to ensure that my portfolio page is viewable at multiple viewports.
